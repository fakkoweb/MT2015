A VR/AR setup/application must deal with different aspects. Three are the main fields of expertise:
computer vision: describes the techniques for displaying/enhancing images and extrapolating information by means of imaging sensors as cameras according to different models. Stereo vision addresses a specific set of  problems regarding the use of two cameras in order to achieve more information and the stereoscopic effect similar to the human vision.
virtual reality: models mathematically the real world and aims to reproduce that feel in human users. It comprehends also techniques for image enhancement, but in this case images are entirely generated by the model. Also in this case a model is used for a camera observing a scene, even though fictional.
