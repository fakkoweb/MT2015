\subsection{HMD and head tracking}

\subsection{Camera for stereo}
low cost
best resolution/fps rate

\subsection{3D Engine for VR environment}
OculusSDK
Ogre3D

\subsection{Libraries for CV and AR}
OpenCV + tbb + cuda
arUco



%\section{Application pipeline}


\section{Camera image pipeline}

\subsection{Frame timing and pose estimation}
TIME\\
Approximate: simply get time before grab new frame\\
Precise-auto: compute image-to-grab delay from frame timestamp (if available)\\
Precise-manual: set image-to-grab delay manually\\
POSE\\
Approximate: get the current pose before grab new frame\\
Predicted: predict the pose in the past by a delay\\
Precise: get the current pose a delay before calling grab()\\
\subsection{Image elaboration}

\subsubsection{Lens distortion correction}
\subsubsection{Marker detection}
reference mapping between Ogre and arUco\\
pivot offset to place the object on the marker\\
undistort tolerance\\

\subsubsection{Image effect/enhancement}

\subsubsection{A Cuda-ready pipeline}

\subsection{Frame synchronization}

\section{3D Rendering pipeline}

\subsection{Enhanced head model}

\subsection{Virtual eye render mapping to real eye}

\subsection{Camera image mapping to virtual eye}

Suppose camera is in the same position of the eye (as aruco) \\
aruco detected object must be placed relative to the scene (after detected) \\


better marker detection with two cameras? who cares \\



\subsubsection{pin-hole camera model}
\subsubsection{fish-eye camera model}

\subsection{Image stabilization}
Image pose application \\
Head stabilization \\
Eye stabilization \\

\section{Stereo Rig design}
alignment of cameras is critical!

\subsection{wide-angle lens configuration}
TOED-IN
(-) edge violation, "see through a window" effect (lower immersion)
(-) keystoning effect at edges, but reducible
(+) compensate the low stereo cues area of parallel config
(+) easy to implement
(+) good vertical disparities (VSR)

\subsection{fish-eye lens configuration}
PARALLEL with high fov
(+) no edge violation (close objects are welcome, high immersion)
(+) no keystoning
(+) no need to toe-in to compensate low fov..
(-) .. but still can be very distorted at edge (need high quality lens!)
(-) no stereo cues at the edge of the image
(-) hard to implement (due to additional undistortion)
(+) good vertical disparities (VSR)

\subsection{3D printed prototype (?)}
