Q: WHY ISN'T THERE ONLY ONE SCRIPT THAT DOES ALL??
A: I could install all I need locally and use it instead of asking you to install it.. but
   a local version of cmake does not find all the libraries.. so at least update it!!
Three major truths:
- Ogre 1.9 to compile requires at least cmake 2.8.9
- Ogre Dependencies require at least cmake 2.8.11
- If you use a local user version of cmake, it won't find all system installed libraries
If you are on a system running an older version of cmake, g++, boost and also you have no admin rights, follow this steps. Expect errors and retries.
--------------ON ARAGORN (cmake 2.8.9 gcc 4.6 boost x.x.x no admin rights)-------------------
Install locally 2.8.12 using script
Make it default cmake by adding its variable (to run it)
Open a new terminal (to detect it) and run dependencies script
Move the local cmake from its current position, so a new terminal will find cmake 2.8.9
If boost is too old: open Ogre install script and remove boost support (change it to 0 in the script)
Open ANOTHER terminal (to detect 2.8.9) and run Ogre script
If cmake 2.8.9 gives errors it is ok: check it found the needed libraries, which are now in cache, then:
	move again the local version of cmake back to its position
	run the lines of Ogre script manually from a new terminal from cmake line (it is in the script)
	remove back again from the position the local cmake, so now 2.8.9 works again
You have finally Ogre1.9 locally installed!

ARUCO and OPENCV:
- Compile the project with cmake 2.8.9
- Change the used OpenCV to the local one
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIPS:
- do not delete sources of Ogre and Dependencies (you would need to go through all the steps again)
- compile both Ogre versions (with and without boost)
- you may encounter similar issues with all other local libraries (this is not really a tip, but use the steps above as a general guide)
- close and reopen terminal when you encounter even stranger issues

ERRORS:
DO NOT COMPILE OGRE 1.9 WITH BOOST IF TOO OLD
wierd errors with boost (used by Ogre or OpenCV)

ERRORS WHILE COMPILING OCULUS SDK or ARUCO
Use gcc 4.8 and flag c++11, specify it in cmake to be sure (easy if using a GUI)
If does not work, delete cache and build directory, redo all configure from scratch


OCULUS:
(for this steps use the files included in libs/OculusSDK)
https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/2rjklz/ubuntu_i_got_an_oculus_but_where_do_i_get_started/
1 - "ConfigureDebian.sh" (needed to install dependencies and rules.d file for device)
2 - service: "ovrd"
3 - config: "RiftConfigUtil" (to set up profiles)
